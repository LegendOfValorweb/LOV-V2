🤖 AI INTEGRATED STORY MODE — PLANNING
1️⃣ Core Goals
Dynamic Story Generation: AI generates quests, events, and interactions personalized to player stats, Rank, Tower progress, and companions.
Controlled Freedom: AI must enforce unlocks and main story consistency, preventing access to zones, skills, or items the player hasn’t earned.
NPC Integration: Every zone has AI-generated NPCs relevant to the story.
TXT/2D Visual Interface: Player sees a static portrait at bottom-left, interactive entity at bottom-right, with visual placeholders for unknown entities.
Zone Entry: Clicking a zone triggers a zone screen with a loading placeholder, maintaining immersion.
2️⃣ AI Story Generation Rules
a) Player-Aware Story Constraints
AI can read player state:
Stats, Pot, Rank, Level, Tower floor, Companion stage
Inventory, unlocked skills, current quests, zone access
AI restrictions:
Cannot give tasks that require skills, pets, or Rank the player doesn’t have
Cannot send the player to zones they haven’t unlocked
Pot influence: AI can suggest storylines aligned with player Pot type (e.g., offensive Pot → combat-heavy quests)
b) Main Story Integration
Main story acts as guiding framework: Awakening → Fractured Realms → Hell Zone → Convergence War
AI can generate:
Subplots
Personalized NPC missions
Zone-specific side quests
Must reference main story events to avoid contradiction
3️⃣ NPCs in Zones
a) NPC Generation
Each zone dynamically spawns NPCs relevant to the AI story
NPC Types:
Quest givers
Traders / resource helpers
Lore characters
Event triggers
b) Interaction Rules
AI reads player stats and history to determine NPC dialogue and quests
Dialogue and quests scale with:
Rank
Tower floor
Companion evolution / bond
Visual representation:
Assigned portrait if available
Otherwise: black silhouette
4️⃣ Zone Interaction Flow
Player clicks a zone → triggers zone transition
Loading screen → can show tips, lore snippets, or NPC silhouettes
Zone view:
Static background map or scene
Player character portrait bottom-left
Interactable entity (NPC, resource, monster) bottom-right
Textual prompts for action (talk, attack, gather, interact)
a) Visual Rules
Player portrait: always bottom-left
Interacting entity: bottom-right
Unknown entity: black silhouette / TXT placeholder
Optional: add border color or glow for rare NPCs or story-critical entities
5️⃣ AI-Driven Quest / Interaction System
Quest Generation
AI uses player state, unlocked zones, and companions to craft quests
Quest objectives always achievable given current stats, skills, companions
Rewards scale with difficulty and zone risk
Dynamic Dialogue
NPC dialogue generated based on:
Player history
AI story path
Companion / pet presence
Integration with Gameplay
AI-generated quests award:
Stat XP
Gold / materials
Companion items or Bond XP
AI can trigger optional bonus encounters with zone-specific NPCs
6️⃣ TXT / 2D-Friendly Representation
Element
Visual / TXT Representation
Player
Static portrait bottom-left
Entity / NPC
Portrait bottom-right (if exists) / black silhouette if missing
Zone
Static 2D background / icon grid
Interactions
Text-based buttons or prompt commands (e.g., “Talk / Attack / Gather”)
AI Quest Updates
Inline textual notifications or pop-up messages
7️⃣ Optional Enhancements
Zone transition effects: simple fade-in/out for loading screen
NPC rarity indicators: border glow or icon for story-critical NPCs
Pot-based story influence: offensive, defensive, or hybrid Pot affects AI mission style
Dynamic companion mentions: AI can include pets or birds in dialogue or quest objectives
