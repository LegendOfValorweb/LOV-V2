Legends of Valor: The Ultimate Comprehensive Encyclopedia
This summary details every mechanical layer, world element, and background system currently existing in the game.
1. Core Character Infrastructure
• Race System (14 Variants): Permanent choice at creation. Modifiers apply to base stats (Str, Def, Spd, Int, Luck).
• Examples: Titans have massive Str/Def but 0.8x Spd. Fae have 1.2x Luck but low survivability.
• Rank System (15 Tiers): Scales from Novice (1-10k power) to Mythical Legend (Max rank). Ranks gatekeep zones and equipment tiers.
• Stat Mechanics:
• Potential (Pot): Hidden growth multiplier that increases damage and defense efficiency.
• Health (HP): Calculated as 100 + (Str * 5) + (Def * 3) + (Level * 10).
• Death & Permadeath:
• Ghost State: Occurs at 0 HP. Prevents all actions until respawn.
• Respawn: Free return to Base.
• Revive Tokens: Consumable for instant revival.
• Pet Sacrifice: A "Loyal Bond" mechanic where you can delete an equipped pet to come back to life instantly.
2. World Zones & Activity Layers
The World Map features 12 interactive zones, each with unique sub-systems:
• Capital City:
• Item Shop: Buy Weapons, Armor, and Accessories gated by Rank.
• Trading: Secure P2P window with multi-item lock-in.
• Guild Hall: Create/manage guilds and access the shared Guild Bank.
• Mystic Tower:
• Progression: 50 Floors, each with 100 Levels (Total 5,000 levels).
• Scaling: Enemy stats increase exponentially per floor.
• The Base (Personal Fortress):
• Upgrade Tiers: Camp → Lodge → Keep → Manor → Castle.
• Room Systems:
• Storage: Expands inventory.
• Rest: Passive HP regeneration.
• Crafting: Unlocks high-tier equipment recipes.
• Training: Converts time into passive Stat XP.
• Vault: Generates interest on stored Gold and protects it from PvP loss.
• Defenses: Upgradable traps (Arrow Traps, Magic Wards) to defend against random raids.
• Resource & Gathering Zones:
• Crystal Lake: Fishing mechanic where caught fish can be fed to pets for stat transfers.
• Ruby Mines: High-risk PvP zone where you mine for rare Rubies.
• Enchanted Forest: Gathering materials for the base's Crafting Workshop.
• Hell Zone: Endgame PvPvE area. Highest rewards, but death penalties are maximized.
3. Companion Systems
• Pets:
• Evolution (6 Stages): Egg → Baby → Teen → Adult → Legend → Mythic.
• Elemental Convergence: Pets can have up to 3 elements. Matching your pet's element to your race/weapon provides a 5x damage multiplier.
• Bonding: Spending time/currency with a pet increases "Bond Level," providing flat stat bonuses to the player.
• Rebirth: Reset a Mythic pet to Level 1 for permanent "Rebirth Multipliers" on stats.
• Skins: Cosmetic overrides for pet appearances (e.g., Shadow Stalker or Celestial Flame).
• Birds:
• Secondary companions that focus on Defense and Speed buffs.
• Upgraded using Focus Shards and Beak Coins.
4. Tactical Combat Engine (V2)
• Initiative: (Spd * 2) + random(Luck / 10). Determines who strikes first.
• Defense Reduction: Uses a diminishing returns formula: 1 - min(Def / (Def + 100), 0.75). Defense never reaches 100% reduction.
• Critical Hits: Capped at 25% chance. Multiplier: 1.5 + (Luck / 500).
• Elemental Multipliers:
• Neutral: 1.0x
• Resisted: 0.5x
• Strong: 1.25x
• Double Synergy: 2.0x
• Triple Synergy (Convergence): 5.0x
• Actions:
• Trick: Successful trick (Luck-based) deals 1.5x damage and can Stun (skip enemy turn).
• Dodge: Uses Speed difference to attempt a 100% damage avoidance.
5. Economic & Event Systems
• Skill Auction: Real-time global events where players bid Valor Tokens ($Valor) on unique skills. Only one of each skill exists per server.
• Global Events:
• Mandatory Events: Players must register or face world-debuffs.
• Tournament Grounds: Structured PvP brackets with specialized rewards like Soul Gins or Mythic Shards.
• AI Game Master:
• Personalized Quests: AI analyzes your inventory and progress to write unique quest objectives.
• Lore Integration: Context-aware dialogue based on the 4-act story (Awakening → Fractured Realms → Hell Zone → Convergence War).
6. Technical Persistence
• Database: PostgreSQL/Drizzle saves every action (inventory, quest state, pet bonding).
• Real-time Updates: SSE (Server-Sent Events) push global notifications (new players, auction bids, guild chat) without refreshing the page.
• State Management: React Query manages the cache for smooth transitions between world zones.
