V2 COMBAT RESOLUTION – TURN‑BY‑TURN LOGIC (DEV‑READY)
This defines exactly how a battle is resolved, from matchmaking → hidden mechanics → damage math → victory. Designed for PvE, PvP, Guild fights, Pet PvP, and Hell Zone.
1. COMBAT INITIALIZATION
1.1 Battle Types
• PvE: Player vs NPC / Boss
• PvP: 1v1, Duo, Team/Guild (1 fighter at a time)
• Pet PvP: Up to 3 pets per side, turn‑based raid‑style
• Hell Zone: Mixed PvP/PvE, high‑risk
1.2 Pre‑Battle Phase (Poker Phase)
Executed before Turn 1.
Each participant may have:
• 0–N Hidden Mechanics (secret skills, traps, curses, blessings)
• 1 One‑Time Surprise (if equipped)
Rules:
• Hidden effects are not visible until triggered
• Once triggered → fully revealed
• Cannot be changed mid‑battle
Examples:
• One‑time revive at 0 HP
• Forced dodge on first lethal hit
• Damage reflection on first attack
2. TURN ORDER CALCULATION
2.1 Initiative Formula
Initiative = SPD × (1 + RankModifier) × Random(0.9 – 1.1) 
• Highest initiative acts first
• Re‑calculated only if a speed‑altering effect occurs
2.2 Guild / Team Battles
• Only 1 active fighter per team
• When a fighter dies: 
• Next member enters immediately
• Winner keeps current HP, cooldowns, buffs
3. PLAYER TURN STRUCTURE
Each turn follows this strict order:
STEP 1 – Start‑of‑Turn Triggers
• Damage over time
• Regeneration
• Curse countdowns
• Pet assist procs
STEP 2 – Action Selection
Player chooses one:
A. ATTACK
• Basic attack OR
• Skill OR
• Item use
B. DEFEND
• Shield block
• Pet guard
• Brace (reduced damage)
C. TRICK (Poker / Mind Game)
• Chance‑based
• Influenced by INT + LCK
• Examples: 
• Fake attack
• Steal buff
• Force cooldown
D. DODGE
• SPD‑based
• Success chance scales with rank
4. HIT & EVADE CHECKS
4.1 Dodge Check
DodgeChance = (SPD / (EnemySPD + SPD)) × RankScaler 
If successful → attack misses entirely
4.2 Trick Resolution
TrickSuccess = (INT + LCK) vs (EnemyINT + EnemyLCK) 
Success → effect applied Failure → wasted action
5. DAMAGE CALCULATION (QUINTILLION SAFE)
5.1 Base Damage
BaseDamage = (STR or SkillPower) × SkillMultiplier 
5.2 Defense Reduction
ReducedDamage = BaseDamage × (BaseDamage / (BaseDamage + DEF)) 
5.3 Elemental Resolution
Apply in order:
• Dual Bond (player + pet + gear + weapon same element)
• ×2 damage
• Full Element Stack (5 same elements)
• ×5 damage
• Element Counter
• Damage reduced or negated
• Pet Death Rule
• If pet dies → bond bonuses disabled
5.4 Critical / Luck Roll
CritChance = LCK × RankModifier CritDamage = ×1.5 – ×3 (rarity‑based) 
6. PET ASSIST SYSTEM
Pets may trigger once per turn:
Possible actions:
• Extra hit
• Buff ally
• Heal
• Shield
• Trigger hidden skill
Chance scales with:
• Pet level
• Bond level
• Rank
7. COOLDOWNS & RESOURCES
7.1 Cooldown Scaling
• Low rarity / high power → long cooldown
• High rarity / high rank → low or zero cooldown
7.2 No Shared Cooldowns
• Each fighter tracks cooldowns independently
8. DEATH & REVIVAL LOGIC
8.1 On Death (HP ≤ 0)
Check in order:
• One‑time revive effect
• Pet sacrifice revive
• Guild assist (if applicable)
If none → death confirmed
8.2 Death Outcomes
PvP
• Item/resource drop possible
• Win/loss recorded
• Respawn at base or Capital City
PvE
• Stat penalty / curse possible
• No leaderboard impact
9. VICTORY CONDITIONS
Battle ends when:
• All enemy fighters defeated
• All enemy pets defeated (Pet PvP)
Rewards distributed immediately:
• Resources
• Rank points
• Leaderboard updates
• Hidden achievement checks
10. ANTI‑EXPLOIT ENFORCEMENT
• Skill/rank usage validated every turn
• No stat injection beyond caps
• Hidden mechanics server‑verified
11. WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS
✔ Skill > raw stats ✔ Poker‑style mind games ✔ No button mashing (auto systems supported) ✔ Fair PvP despite quintillion scaling ✔ Endless depth for V3 expansion
This combat logic is ready to be coded directly into backend + frontend.
V2 STAT & DAMAGE SCALING CURVES (QUINTILLION-SAFE)
This defines how stats grow, how damage scales, and how the game remains fair from Rank 1 → Mythical Legend.
All formulas are designed to:
• Avoid stat overflow
• Prevent one-shot dominance
• Keep strategy relevant at all tiers
1. CORE STAT LIST
Player & Pet Stats:
• STR (Strength)
• DEF (Defense)
• INT (Intelligence)
• VIT (HP pool)
• SPD (Speed)
• LCK (Luck)
Elemental Power handled separately.
2. RANK POWER TIERS
Rank TierRank RangePower BandBeginner1–31 – 10,000Intermediate4–610K – 10MAdvanced7–910M – 10BMastery10–1210B – 10TLegendary13–1510T – 9 Quintillion 
Power = aggregate stat + gear + pet contribution.
3. BASE STAT GROWTH FORMULA
BaseStat = (Rank^2.2) × RaceModifier × TrainingModifier 
RaceModifier: 0.9 – 1.2 TrainingModifier: 1.0 – 5.0
This creates accelerating but controlled growth.
4. HP (VIT) SCALING
HP = VIT × 12 × RankScaler RankScaler = 1 + (Rank / 10) 
Prevents instant kills while allowing burst windows.
5. DAMAGE SCALING (ANTI-ONE-SHOT)
Damage is logarithmic at high values.
EffectiveDamage = RawDamage × ( RawDamage / (RawDamage + TargetHP × 0.15) ) 
Results:
• Low power fights feel punchy
• High power fights require multiple turns
6. DEFENSE DIMINISHING RETURNS
DamageAfterDEF = Incoming × ( Incoming / (Incoming + DEF × 1.25) ) 
DEF never reaches immunity.
7. SPEED & TURN CONTROL
SPD advantage caps at ±35% initiative swing.
InitiativeBonus = min( (SPDdiff / EnemySPD), 0.35 ) 
No infinite speed builds.
8. LUCK SCALING (POKER SYSTEM)
Luck influences:
• Critical chance
• Trick success
• Hidden mechanic discovery
LuckEffect = log10(LCK + 10) 
High LCK helps — never guarantees.
9. ELEMENTAL POWER SCALING
Element damage uses multipliers, not raw stats.
ConditionMultiplierDual Bond×2Full 5-stack×5Countered×0.5 – 0Immunity0 
Keeps element strategy dominant without stat bloat.
10. PET SCALING
Pets scale slightly behind players to prevent dominance.
PetStat = PlayerStat × (0.6 – 0.9 based on bond & rarity) 
Merged pets increase ceiling, not speed.
11. SKILL POWER SCALING
SkillPower = Base × RarityMultiplier × RankFactor RarityMultiplierCommon1.0Rare1.4Epic2.0Legendary3.0Mythic5.0 
RankFactor = 1 + (Rank / 8)
12. COOLDOWN SCALING
Cooldown = BaseCD / ( RankFactor × SkillMastery ) 
At max rank + mastery → zero cooldown possible.
13. WHY THIS SCALING HOLDS
✔ Quintillion-safe ✔ PvP viable at all ranks ✔ No stat walls ✔ Rewards preparation, not grinding ✔ Perfect base for V3 inflation
This document finalizes V2’s mathematical backbone.
Enemy Tier Scaling (Zone-Based)
This section defines how enemies scale by world zone, not by player level alone. Zones create predictable difficulty bands so players feel progression when moving across the map.
Core Rule
Enemy Power = Base Tier Stats × Zone Multiplier × Enemy Archetype Modifier
This prevents rubber-banding and keeps early zones relevant but farmable.
Zone Tiers
Tier 1 – Starter Zones (Capital Outskirts, Early Forests)
• HP: x1.0–1.3
• Damage: x1.0–1.2
• AI Complexity: Basic
• Mechanics: Auto-attacks, slow abilities
• Purpose: Learning, confidence building
Tier 2 – Mid Zones (Enchanted Forest, Coastal Village)
• HP: x1.5–2.0
• Damage: x1.3–1.7
• AI Complexity: Reactive
• Mechanics: Dodges, simple combos, status effects
• Purpose: Gear checks, elemental understanding
Tier 3 – Advanced Zones (Mountain Caverns, Ancient Ruins)
• HP: x2.3–3.0
• Damage: x1.8–2.4
• AI Complexity: Tactical
• Mechanics: Shields, phases, interrupts
• Purpose: Build optimization, pet synergy
Tier 4 – Endgame Zones (Mystic Tower, Research Lab)
• HP: x3.5–5.0
• Damage: x2.5–3.5
• AI Complexity: Adaptive
• Mechanics: Counters, debuffs, environment hazards
• Purpose: Skill expression, late-game mastery
Tier 5 – Hell Zone (No Mercy Area)
• HP: x6.0–10.0+
• Damage: x4.0–6.0+
• AI Complexity: Punishing
• Mechanics: One-shot threats, permadeath loops (respawn-tax), anti-heal
• Purpose: Prestige, leaderboards, mythic drops
Enemy Archetype Modifiers
• Minion: HP x0.6 | Damage x0.7 | Fast spawn
• Elite: HP x1.8 | Damage x1.6 | Special mechanics
• Champion: HP x3.0 | Damage x2.2 | Phase-based fights
• Boss: HP x8.0+ | Damage x3.5+ | Arena mechanics
Archetypes stack after zone scaling.
Anti-Overlevel Protection
If Player Power exceeds Zone Power by >40%:
• Enemy HP +20%
• Enemy Damage +10%
• Drop quality reduced slightly
This preserves farming without letting zones become meaningless.
Why This Works
• Zones feel distinct and memorable
• Auto-level & auto-combat stay fair
• PvE difficulty stays stable even with power creep
• PvP remains unaffected (separate scaling layer)
This system locks in fair challenge, clear progression, and long-term balance.
